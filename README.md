**1. About The Project**   
Page for the online-store Aurora (test task for the trainee position).

**2. Built With:**   
HTML;
CSS (SCSS);
JavaScript (JQuery).

**3. Getting Started**   
If you want to see the completed solution just clone the repo or you can visit this link https://katerynapovo.github.io/aurora/

**4. Code reviewer's notes**   
In SCSS I used variables for color and font-weight, mixins for text properties.
On the main page, a carousel was implemented  with two pictures changing one another.
Also when you click on 'sign in | register' you will be redirected to another page.
The website is responsive and can be viewed from different mobile devises.
